# About Me

I've been working in programming since the late 1980s, a time when mobile phones were the size and weight of bricks and all you could do with them was make phone calls.

Professionally I spend most of my time using C++, but when not working on other peoples' stuff I like to mess around with other languages as well. At the moment I'm (finally) getting around to playing with Python - just don't expect to see any of my Python code on here in the near future, it's far too raw to be seen in the wild...

Having some time for my own projects over the past few months, I've been working on articles on various programming topics. As and when they are published they will appear in my 'articles' repository.

# Why 'dustycorner'?

Originally it was intended as the name for a regular column on the dusty corners of C++. I haven't actually gotten around to starting on that work yet, but I liked the name so it seemed like a good one to use for my Github (and Gitlab/BitBucket) account.
